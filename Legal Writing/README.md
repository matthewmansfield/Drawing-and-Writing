Hello There! 

I have a great deal of writing experience in many venues (legal, computer, hand, etc.). This area is designed to display a few things regarding legal writing which is to include:
- Filing a Petition
- Filing a Motion
- Filing a Response to Motion

As well as some other things. Please note, all documents are formatted and structured based upon acceptable works/practices found within Maricopa County, Arizona, USA. 

DISCLAIMER! You are on Github. I am not an attorney. Those are two importain facts you should be aware of just now. If you cannot connect the dots from there, here are some light reading/research suggestions that may help: 
- First, navigate your web browser to www.google.com, then search for the following:
- "what is a legal disclaimer"
- "legit sources for legal advice"
- "would a reasonable person use Github for legal advice"
- "can I sue a guy on Github because I messed up with my legal filings"
- "am I responsible for my own legal decisions"

these should be enough to get you started. If you cannot understand what is being said here, then in the words of Michael Jordan, "Stop it. Get some help." If you run into any bumps in the road, again, I'm not an attorney. Don't reach out to me. I am in no way responsible for what you do with this information. This is for educational purposes only.

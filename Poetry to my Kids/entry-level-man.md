Entry Level Man
By Matthew Mansfield

A toilet is backing?
A commercial needs acting?

A construction zone needs flagging?
 Some groceries need bagging?

Entry Level-Man to the rescue!

A pipe is leaking,
And your wife is shrieking?

A table needs waiting?
Your lawn could use raking?

Entry Level-Man to the rescue!

Before I pay rent 
All of my money is spent

Minimum wage is my prize
 I thru schooling aside

Who needs education I am not afraid
Thanks to government my retirements paid

Nights and weekends, will do
 holidays and birthdays, too

Religion’s not respected
Sleep is not expected

Because it’s 
Entry Level-Man to the rescue!

Whenever I’m feeling down at the jobs that I do
I pause for a moment then shout out to you…

Entry Level-Man to the rescue!

A Tire I Am
By Matthew Mansfield

A tire I am, strong and fresh in my speed
I am of myself the source of my own need

No parts of this vehicle need I for strength
To travel here and there across this highway’s length

I am here, look all, and gather around
What a ta-do I am. I’m black and I’m round.

Rolling and rolling, with a pop and a hiss
What is this? My once firm ground hug has turned to a kiss

Why does the road feel so close and so strong.
This is not right, no, something is wrong.

The side of the road, wait this is not where I belong
I am not weak, I am always so strong.

My bolts are loosened and with a quick jerk and a twirl
In the trunk with the tools? I’m a bright shiny pearl!

It’s dark now, this space is small and confining
This stabbing pain in my heart,
A nail seems to have breached my lining

Repairs have restored me, I am better now more than worse
I roll again, but not like at first

The air in me is cool, not hot like before
I am not the only one there is, look there are three more.

I see how others make this drive a song
The journey is better when you take friends along.
